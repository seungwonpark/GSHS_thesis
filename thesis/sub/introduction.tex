\section{Introduction}
Artificial muscles have been largely studied in Robotics for performing human's delicate movement \cite{ashley}. Recently, super-coiled polymer(SCP) artificial muscle and its striking features were discovered by Haines \etal \cite{haines} \scp is a new kind of artificial muscle which can be easily fabricated by simply twisting a nylon thread excessively. This artificial muscle contracts when heated and relaxes when cooled.

It is known as \scp can provide fast, nonhysteretic, strong, and large stroke with low cost\cite{yuan, mirvakili, madden}. 
Since \scp was announced in 2014, it is widely being studied, such as application on
wearable robots \cite{sphincter, kianzad2}, 
anthropomorphic robotic hand\cite{yip, finger}, 
and modeling of its mechanism \cite{treatise, torsional, youngmodulus, fab_coil, multiscale, healing, kianzad, moretti}. 
But, appropriate circumstances for SCP artificial muscle%, especially cooling device, 
hadn't been studied enough to apply this artificial muscle into real robots.

In Haines \etal, it presents \scp 's heating method - fabricating \scp with silver coated nylon thread and applying electric current, which provides Joule heat to muscle \cite{haines}. This method was checked and applied by several works \cite{yip, mirvakili,kianzad,sphincter,kianzad2}. However, methods for cooling \scp have been largely unsuccessful to date. 
Cooling by water flow was tried\cite{haines,finger}, but it may cause life shortage of \scp \cite{haines}, and hard to apply on robots. Also, cooling fan was used in Yip \etal, but it didn't get sufficiently fast cooling speed.

In this paper, \antanospace, which is actuated by two of the complementarily contracting \scpnospace, was assemblied and its operating system was attached. Also, behavior of \scp and \anta was simply modeled with linear equations and tested experimentally. By quantifying thermal conductivity, possibility of feedback cooling was confirmed. In conclusion, algorithms for sustainable \apc was designed, performed, and simulated.
