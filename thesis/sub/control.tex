\section{Control}
Based on mathematical modeling of the \scpsnospace, their control strategies and results are shown. Also, the \anta was controlled to follow the desired position, which is a function of time. This management will be called as `\apcnospace'.

\subsection{Basic Strategy for the \APC}
By assuming that $\ddot{\theta}$ and $\dot{\theta}$ are small enough, we could observe correlation between $\theta$ and $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$ from \eqref{EqAnta} as \eqref{simple_assume}.
\begin{equation} \label{simple_assume}
\theta = \frac{c}{2kr}(T_{1}-T_{2}).
\end{equation}
By multiplying Laplace transformed equations of \eqref{thermo-electrical_model} and \eqref{simple_assume}, transfer function of $P$ and $\theta$ was discovered as \eqref{apc_transfer}.

\begin{equation} \label{apc_transfer}
\frac{\theta(s)}{P(s)} = \frac{c/2kr}{C_{th}s+\lambda}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the process of controlling $\theta$ into $\theta_{ref}$ by applying constant power can be shown as block diagram in figure \ref{AntaControl_constant}. 

In this situation, $K_{\theta,P}$ is constant. By applying constant power to only one of the muscles, $\theta$ at steady state was measured. Linear fitting of figure \ref{KthetaP} gave us the following constant.

\begin{equation}
K_{\theta,P} = \SI{0.185}{\watt\per\degree}. \notag
\end{equation}
For the fast and precise control, a lead compensator was added and subsequently, feedback, and feedforward control were applied, as can be seen in figure \ref{position_open_loop}, \ref{position_closed_loop}.

\subsection{Antagonistic Position Control Strategy}
In this section, we aim to make a simple sin wave motion of the \anta as \eqref{theta_ref}. By doing this, we could check the possibility of the \apc for any complicated motion. Basically, according to the equation \eqref{simple_assume}, we could increase $\theta$ by heating muscle 1 and decrease $\theta$ by heating muscle 2. Therefore, strategy shown in Table.\ref{table_apc_basic} was used.
%By assuming that $\ddot{\theta}$ and $\dot{\theta}$ is small enough, \eqref{EqAnta} can be approximated into \eqref{EqAngleTempDiff}.

%\begin{equation}\label{EqAngleTempDiff}
%\theta=\frac{c}{2kr}(T_1-T_2)
%\end{equation}



\begin{equation}\label{theta_ref}
\theta_{ref}(t)=(\SI{9}{\degree})\sin(2\pi 0.025t)
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[t]
	\caption{Basic strategy for the \apc.}
	\label{table_apc_basic}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c}
			\hline
			Time(s) & 0-10 & 10-20 & 20-30 & 30-40 \\

			Muscle 2 & Keep & Heat & Heat & Keep \\
			\hline
			$\theta$ & increase & decrease & decrease & increase \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

Since the Laplace transformation of \eqref{theta_ref} is too complicated, 
it was approximated as \eqref{theta_ref_approx} by dividing \eqref{theta_ref} into 12 steps. In this case, demanded power can be calculated as \eqref{power_derived} since $n=12$.
\footnote{In equation \eqref{power_derived}, $\theta_{ref,pre}$ is a value of $\theta_{ref}$ in the previous step. Also, $t$ is elapsed time after starting a new step.}
\footnote{$U(t)$ is unitary step function.}
\begin{equation} \label{theta_ref_approx}
\begin{aligned} 
%\theta_{ref}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{(\theta_{ref,i+1}-\theta_{ref,i})U(t-i\Delta T)} 
\theta_{ref}(t) & = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{(\theta_{ref,i+1}-\theta_{ref,i})U(t-i\Delta T)} \\
& = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{\left(\sin{\frac{2(i+1)\pi}{n}}-\sin{\frac{2i\pi}{n}}\right)U\left(t-40\frac{i}{n}\right)}. \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{power_derived}
P(t)=\theta_{ref}K_{\theta,P}\left(1+\left(\frac{\theta_{ref}-\theta_{ref,pre}}{\theta_{ref}}\right)\left(\frac{\tau}{\tau_{des}}-1\right)e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{des}}}\right).
\end{equation}

 %Through these steps, we can do \apc as a sin wave form.

\subsection{Sustainable Antagonistic Position Control Strategy}\label{section_simulation}
The method for making sin wave motion was discussed previously. However, since the temperature of the muscles in the initial state and final state is significantly different, it won't be sustainable because the temperature will be rising for a long time. Therefore, we needed to make the temperature of the initial state and final state the same. This was performed by cooling the muscle during the last 1/4 period of sin wave, as shown in Table \ref{table_apc_sustain}.

\begin{table}[t]
	\caption{Sustainable \apc strategy.}

			\hline
			Muscle 1 & $T_0$ & Heat & Keep & Keep & Weakly Cool & Heat & $T_0$ \\
			Muscle 2 & $T_0$ & Keep & Heat & Heat & Strongly Cool & Keep & $T_0$ \\

\tocless \subsubsection{Demonstration - Two Period Sin Wave}
First, we demonstrated open-loop control of cooling speed by trying two-period sin wave control. In this demonstration, cooling was done during $t=$ \SI{40}{\second} - \SI{50}{\second}.\footnote{This slightly differs from the Table \ref{table_apc_sustain}.} To cool as much as possible, muscle 2 was cooled for all the time, and muscle 1 was `weakly' cooled by repeatedly opening and closing the solenoid valve. As a result, we got an rms error 26.6\% for the open-loop control, and 6.7\% for the closed-loop control.(Figure \ref{sustain_demo})

%After the demonstration, we concluded that an appropriate time for cooling will be \SI{30}{\second}-\SI{40}{\second}, not \SI{40}{\second} - \SI{50}{\second}. It is because

\end{figure}

\tocless \subsubsection{Simulation - Feedback Control of Thermal Conductivity}


Integrating \eqref{dynamic_calculation_tau} and \eqref{lambda_control}, \eqref{tau_modification} was gained.
\begin{equation} \label{tau_modification} 
\begin{aligned} 
\tau & = \frac{C_{th}}{\lambda} \\
& = \frac{1.81}{0.77\cdot r + 0.10}. \\ 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Also, by differentiating \eqref{simple_assume} and \eqref{theta_ref} with respect to time, \eqref{theta_diff} was drawn, where $t$ refers to time elapsed since $t=\SI{30}{\second}$.

\begin{equation} \label{theta_diff}
\begin{aligned} 
\frac{d\theta}{dt} & = \frac{c}{2kr}\cdot\frac{d}{dt}(T_{1}-T_{2}) \\
& = 9^{\circ}(2\pi\cdot 0.025)\sin{2\pi\cdot 0.025t}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
What we had to do was to decrease $(T_{1}+T_{2})/2$, so \eqref{diff_t1+t2} was used. Constant $\alpha$ was carefully determined by several simulations.
\begin{equation} \label{diff_t1+t2}
\frac{d}{dt}(T_{1}+T_{2}) = -\alpha(T_{1}+T_{2}-2T_{ambient})
\end{equation}
Therefore, by using \eqref{thermo-electrical_model} for the each muscle, $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ need to be calculated. The block diagram which represents feedback control of thermal conductivities is shown in figure \ref{diagram_sustainable}.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Diagram(v4)_sustainable.pdf}
	\caption{Block diagram for the sustainable \apcnospace.}
	\label{diagram_sustainable}
\end{figure}

To make sustainable \apc possible, $\lambda$ must be between $\SI{0.25}{\watt\per\degreeCelsius}$ and $\SI{0.60}{\watt\per\degreeCelsius}$  all the time, according to \eqref{lambda_control}. Therefore, possibility of this control strategy was verified by thermal simulation.
%We can guess that $\lambda_{1}$ have to decrease and $\lambda_{2}$ have to increase. 

Thermal conductivity of two muscles - $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ must hit its limit as late as possible. 
This duration was determined by constant $\alpha$ in \eqref{diff_t1+t2}. 
In figure \ref{Sinwave_C_T}, we observed that two of the muscles' average temperatures had increased approximately \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}. This means that we had to cool down the average temperature at least \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}. 
But, this optimization couldn't be solved algebraically, so it was solved by numerical simulation.
Simulation was carefully done by applying \eqref{thermo-electrical_model} and \eqref{EqAnta}, using the constants we got in section \ref{section_modeling}. The 4th order Runge-Kutta method was used to solve the differential equation. 

Through several simulations, we have concluded that $\alpha = 0.25$ is the best. The result of simulation with this value is shown in figure \ref{cool_simulation}. With initial temperature from figure \ref{Sinwave_C_T}, {\it i.e.} $T_{1}=\SI{40}{\degreeCelsius}$ and $T_{2}=\SI{55}{\degreeCelsius}$ at $t=\SI{30}{\second}$, the required thermal conductivity slightly hit the maximum limit. Also, the average temperature didn't decrease over \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}. Therefore, the temperature would increase in this state.

Once average temperature increases, it will be easier to cool the muscles because $dT/dt \propto (T-T_{amb})$. Simulation was repeated with initial temperature $T_{1}=\SI{85}{\degreeCelsius}$ and $T_{2}=\SI{100}{\degreeCelsius}$ at $t=\SI{30}{\second}$. With those initial conditions, there was a dramatic decrease of average temperature. (Figure \ref{cool_control_100}) Also, required thermal conductivity hit the limit after cooling two of the muscles in full degree. 

After reaching the desired amount of cooling, $ \theta $ can be maintained as $\theta_{ref}$ by switching cooling to heating. Finally, we concluded that feedback cooling control is possible, so that we were able to make \apc highly sustainable.
