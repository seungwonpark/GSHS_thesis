\section{Conclusion}
Various investigation for method of \scp's efficient control had been done by prior works \cite{haines,mirvakili,yip}. %1
However, these studies hadn't established efficient method for cooling \scp. %2
In this study, we tested the performance of cooling method with compressed air can. %3

We found that thermal conductivity of \scp can be controlled by repeating opening and closing solenoid valve with constant period and variable ratio. %4
