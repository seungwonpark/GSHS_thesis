\section{Conclusion}
Various investigations for the method of \scpnospace's efficient control have been done by preceding researches \cite{haines,mirvakili,yip}. %1
However, these studies haven't established efficient methods for cooling \scpnospace. %2
%This could be solved by using antagonism, but yet not sustainable.
In this study, \antas were made to perform fast response of displacement on two sides, but they were not yet sustainable. Thus, we tested the performance of the cooling method with a compressed air can, to demonstrate the sustainable \apcnospace, and proved it through simulations of thermodynamical models. %3

We found that the thermal conductivity of \scp can be feedback controlled by repeating opening and closing of the solenoid valve in variable ratios for a certain period of time. %4
This is done by using compressed air, which is known to be natural method in operating temperature, along with water cooling \cite{madden}.
Also, this method showed higher thermal conductivity than that of cooling by computer fans \cite{yip}.
Therefore, this study has been extending the achievement of Yip \etal, proving that \apc can be highly sustainable.

Most notably, this is the first study to make thermal conductivity feedback controlled. This could be done by an extraordinary idea - opening and closing of the  solenoid valve repeatedly.
%Since hysteresis of \scp is known to be lower at high temperature \cite{moretti}, 
However, some limitations on this study are worth noting. 
%Required temperature for feedback cooling was too high, which is not energy-efficient.
Compressed air cans had to be replaced frequently because the pressure of them wasn't constant enough. 
Also, solenoid valve's operating sound and vibration were too big to be applied into real robots.
%Future work should therefore try the forced air cooling through tube with big capacity such as Helium tank. 
Further research should therefore establish efficient, mobile cooling methods and or devices for \scps with larger capacity. 
Extra equipments such as portable air compressors can be used as a cooling device.
%This will also provide higher thermal conductivity since Helium have smaller molecular mass than atmosphere.
